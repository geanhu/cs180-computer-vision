        <h3> Part 1 </h3>

        <div class="image-gallery">
            <figure>
                <img src="images/project0-part1-2.jpg" class="gallery-photo">
                <figcaption>
                    Close selfie: face appears narrow 
                    with larger central features (e.g. nose),
                    but small peripheral features (e.g. ears).
                </figcaption>
            </figure>
            
            <figure>

                <figcaption>
                    Far selfie: face appears flat
                    and non-distorted.
                </figcaption>
            </figure>
        </div>

        <p>
            When the face is close to the camera, the ratio of the distance from
            the camera to close features (e.g. nose) : the distance from the camera to
            far features (e.g. ears) is very high and disproportionate, causing distortion (left).
            In contrast, when the camera is placed further, because the distances between the 
            face features (e.g. how much the nose sticks out from the face plane) is much lower
            than the distance of the camera to the face plane, that distortion is no longer
            present.

        <h3>Part 2</h3>

        <div class="image-gallery">
            <figure>
                <img src="images/project0-part2-1.jpg" class="gallery-photo">
                <figcaption>Zoomed-in picture of building</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <figure>
                <img src="images/project0-part2-2.jpg" class="gallery-photo">
                <figcaption>Closer picture of building</figcaption>
            </figure>
        </div>

        <p>
            Similar to Part 1, when far away and zoomed in, the distance from the closest
            point on the building (bottom floor) to the furthest point in the building (top
            floor) is very small in comparison to how far the camera is from the building, causing
            the building to appear flat. However, once closer, the distance between the camera
            to the top and bottom floors is now significantly different, which causes the building
            to appear to lean, as the top floor appears smaller and further from the lens.
