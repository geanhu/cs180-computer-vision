                    Close selfie: face appears narrow 
                    with larger central features (e.g. nose),
                    but small peripheral features (e.g. ears).

                <figcaption>
                    Far selfie: face appears flat
                    and non-distorted.

        <p>
            When the face is close to the camera, the ratio of the distance from
            the camera to close features (e.g. nose) : the distance from the camera to
            far features (e.g. ears) is very high and disproportionate, causing distortion (left).
            In contrast, when the camera is placed further, because the distances between the 
            face features (e.g. how much the nose sticks out from the face plane) is much lower
            than the distance of the camera to the face plane, that distortion is no longer
            present.
